The solution involves using optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access the field. If the field doesn't exist, it gracefully returns `undefined` instead of throwing an error.

```javascript
// bug.js
//This will throw an error if address field doesn't exist
document.address

//bugSolution.js
//This will return undefined if address field doesn't exist
document?.address ?? 'N/A'
```
